## ðŸŒŸ What is this?

The resident portal is an open source project actively developed by SimpleFi (aka p2planes) jointly with the support of EdgeCity and Esmeralda and (hopefully) you!

## ðŸš€ Our Story

We build technology to accelerate the experimentation rate of new forms of human cooperation. We do this by leveraging frontier technologies such as cryptocurrencies, ZK and AI as part of the tool stack of orgs doing the groundwork. After working closely with EdgeCity and Crecimiento, we understood that current tools, both closed and open source were not optimized for our desired use case, so we decided to build our own.

e hope that builders and companies within the pop-up city movement will recognize the value of this project and choose to contribute. We openly welcome the likes of Cursive, ZuPass, RaveApp, Sovs/Consensys, SocialLayer, etc. to join us in this effort.

## How to run locally

```bash
npm install
